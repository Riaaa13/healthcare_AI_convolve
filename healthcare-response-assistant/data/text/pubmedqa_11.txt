QUESTION:
Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications.', 'An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events.', 'One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.'], 'labels': ['PURPOSE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Anticoagulants', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Emergency Treatment', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Postoperative Care', 'Preoperative Care', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety Management', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Trauma Centers', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Warfarin', 'Wounds and Injuries'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['n', 'o'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['n', 'o']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.
