QUESTION:
Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['To evaluate the impact of HER2 immunoreactivity on clinical outcome in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients who received surgery alone, or methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, and cisplatin (M-VEC) as adjuvant chemotherapy.', "We studied 114 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate Cox's analyses.", 'Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p<0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful waiting.'], 'labels': ['INTRODUCTION', 'MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carcinoma', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Methotrexate', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms', 'Urothelium', 'Vinblastine'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e']}

LONG_ANSWER:
HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.
