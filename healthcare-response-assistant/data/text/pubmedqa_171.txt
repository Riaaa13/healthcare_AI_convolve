QUESTION:
Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation.', 'Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse.', 'One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding.'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND AND AIMS', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Child Abuse', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Physical Examination', 'Prospective Studies', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Seizures'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.
