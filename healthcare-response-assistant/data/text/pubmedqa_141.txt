QUESTION:
Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input.', 'The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography.', 'Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.'], 'labels': ['OBJECTIVE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Head Movements', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nystagmus, Physiologic', 'Otolithic Membrane', 'Physical Stimulation', 'Prone Position', 'Reference Values', 'Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular', 'Semicircular Canals', 'Supine Position', 'Young Adult'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal.
