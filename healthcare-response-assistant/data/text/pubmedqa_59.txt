QUESTION:
Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI).', 'Sixty consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted.', 'There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates.'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Balloon Valvuloplasty', 'Cardiac Catheterization', 'Dilatation', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preoperative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement', 'Treatment Outcome'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.
