QUESTION:
Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans.', "Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected.", 'Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02).'], 'labels': ['INTRODUCTION', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['African Americans', 'Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Caregivers', 'Depression', 'Environmental Exposure', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intensive Care Units, Neonatal', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Texas', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this vulnerable population are sorely needed.
