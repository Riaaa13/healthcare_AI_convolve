QUESTION:
Traumatic aortic injury: does the anatomy of the aortic arch influence aortic trauma severity?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the severity of aortic injury.', 'This is a retrospective study of twenty-two cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases.', 'The mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8\xa0cm and 58.3°, respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4\xa0cm and 45.9° in the type III group; 3.3\xa0cm and 37° in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2).'], 'labels': ['PURPOSE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Aorta', 'Aorta, Thoracic', 'Endovascular Procedures', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stents', 'Thoracic Injuries', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Trauma Severity Indices', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.
