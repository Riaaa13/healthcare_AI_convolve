QUESTION:
Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.', 'Multicenter prospective cohort study.', 'Memory clinics in Europe.', 'Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia.', 'IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model.', 'Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square\xa0=\xa04.28, degrees of freedom\xa0=\xa01, P\xa0=\xa0.04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR)\xa0=\xa02.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)\xa0= 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR\xa0=\xa02.11, 95% CI\xa0=\xa01.33-3.33).'], 'labels': ['OBJECTIVES', 'DESIGN', 'SETTING', 'PARTICIPANTS', 'MEASUREMENTS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Dementia', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
IADL disability is a useful addition to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.
