QUESTION:
Should chest wall irradiation be included after mastectomy and negative node breast cancer?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['This study aims to evaluate local failure patterns in node negative breast cancer patients treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy including internal mammary chain only.', 'Retrospective analysis of 92 internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 1998.', 'Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of local failure were age<or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without statistical significance.'], 'labels': ['PURPOSE', 'PATIENTS AND METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mastectomy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thoracic Wall'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age<or = 40 years and larger tumour size.
