QUESTION:
Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD.', 'Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements were obtained in cases comprising 10 different mutations in LCAT, ABCA1 and APOA1 to further evaluate the relationship between low HDL resulting from genetic variation and early atherosclerosis.', 'In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Cholesterol, HDL', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Risk Factors'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['n', 'o'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['n', 'o']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.
