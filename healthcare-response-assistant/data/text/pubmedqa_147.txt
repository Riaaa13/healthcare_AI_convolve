QUESTION:
Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro fertilization outcome.', 'Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (<or = 6 or>6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (<or = 10 or>10 IU/L) and maternal age (<or = 35 or>35 years).', 'The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle>or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively).'], 'labels': ['PURPOSE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Ovarian Follicle', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prospective Studies', 'Ultrasonography'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.
