QUESTION:
Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['The precise correction of refractive error is especially important in young adults. It is unclear whether cycloplegic refraction is necessary in this age group. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults.', 'This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n\u2009=\u2009700) of enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21\xa0years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1\xa0% was installed twice 10\xa0min apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40\xa0min later using an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractive measurements was analyzed.', 'The mean difference in SE between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68\u2009±\u20090.83\xa0D (95\xa0% CI, 0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than myopes (1.30\u2009±\u20090.90\xa0D versus 0.46\u2009±\u20090.68\xa0D, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 to 5\xa0D) demonstrated significantly greater refractive error than mild (0.5 to 2\xa0D) or severe (>5\xa0D) hypermetropes (1.71\u2009±\u20091.18\xa0D versus 1.19\u2009±\u20090.74\xa0D and 1.16\u2009±\u20091.08\xa0D respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001).'], 'labels': ['PURPOSE', 'METHODS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adolescent', 'Cyclopentolate', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperopia', 'Male', 'Military Personnel', 'Mydriatics', 'Myopia', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pupil', 'Refraction, Ocular', 'Retinoscopy', 'Young Adult'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['m', 'a', 'y', 'b', 'e'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Young hypermetropic adults possessed +1 to +2 D of latent hypermetropia. In contrast, young myopic adults revealed pseudomyopia of -0.5 D. Cycloplegic refraction should be performed in young hypermetropic adults complaining of various signs of asthenopia.
