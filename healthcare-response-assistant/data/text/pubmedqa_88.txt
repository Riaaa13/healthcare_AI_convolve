QUESTION:
Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus?

CONTEXT:
{'contexts': ['Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available.', 'To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST.', 'Randomized controlled trial.', 'Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ)\xa0>\xa014 points).', 'All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\xa0=\xa019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\xa0=\xa019).', 'TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline.', 'In all patients (n\xa0=\xa038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\xa0=\xa00.04 and p\xa0<\xa00.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p\xa0=\xa00.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n\xa0=\xa038) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks.'], 'labels': ['BACKGROUND', 'OBJECTIVE', 'DESIGN', 'PATIENTS', 'INTERVENTION', 'MEASUREMENTS', 'RESULTS'], 'meshes': ['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cervical Vertebrae', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck Pain', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Somatosensory Disorders', 'Tinnitus', 'Treatment Outcome'], 'reasoning_required_pred': ['y', 'e', 's'], 'reasoning_free_pred': ['y', 'e', 's']}

LONG_ANSWER:
Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.
